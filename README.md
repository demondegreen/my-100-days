# my-100-days
code from #100DaysOfCode that I have participated in

I didn't appreciate that my checked-in code under the main 100-days-of-code fork does not count as contribution by me on the date.

So rather than continue to put my code under that fork, I am just creating a personal repo so that I can look back at what I have done over time.
